	<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
	<p>These all are activities.I love to do on a regular basis.</p>
        <h2>Physical Activities</h2>
	<h3>Dancing</h3>
	<p>Dance is a movement to the rhythm of music by making a series of steps.<br> When our feet feel the beat of extravagant music and our hand tries to match the rhythm then the pleasant form of dance is born.<br> If I be a little honest then I can say that it is not at all easy to explain dance in words, because according to me dance is a feeling which shows us different cultures and traditions.</p>
	<h3>Reading Books</h3>
	<p>I love to read books in my free time.<br>I feel that reading is a great hobby. Apart from giving pleasure, it also enhances our knowledge.<br> Reading is very beneficial as well as an essential activity that helps in skill-building.<br> Reading a good book gives us joy as well as it also gives the experience to live life smoothly.<br> One of the best benefits of reading books is, it enriches our vocabulary with so many good words.</p>
	<h3>Cricket</h3>
	<p>Well, I have a number of hobbies, but playing cricket is my most favorite hobby.<br>I enjoy playing cricket in my spare time. It makes me feel healthy, stronger, and also keeps me energized.<br> I started taking interest in cricket when I was only five years old.<br>It attracted me as a sport and I was very much fascinated with this game.</p>
